// The asset system has a few goals:
//   *) only load the bits for an asset once per revision of that asset.
//   *) provide a mechanism to implement semantic understanding of any particular asset type.
//   *) provide any given usage site with a unique instance through which to access the asset.
//
// for the first point, the asset system will create an maintain a singleton for each loaded
// revision of an asset.  In general an asset does not have to be a filesystem object, it only
// need to be a blob of data that can be uniquely identified via something that behaves like
// a filesystem path or URL.  Assets are believed to be vaguely hierarchical, where parent
// assets understand how to find and load their immediate children.  This extends beyond
// directories and files, and can include thinsg like sub-assets of files (for example files/
// directories within a tar/archieve, or materials/meshes within a 3D model, etc).  Assets
// may even be entirely proceedural, as long as the asset system knows how to factory them
// (see ExistentAssets).
//
// If an asset supports monitoring it's persistant location for changes, then the implementation
// of that asset type should support update invalidation.  When the persistant location
// changes, the status of any instances of that asset will update to reflect this information.
// Usage sites are not requiered to reload to the most current state of the asset, the older
// state will remain available as long as there are instances using it.  For each revision of an
// asset, the system creates a singleton to manage that revision of that asset.  This singleton
// is never exposed to a usage site.  Rather an instance type, which holds a reference on the
// singleton, is given to usage sites.  These instances semantically contain per-instance
// dynamic state of an asset, where the singleton semantically contains static state for an
// asset.  For example, consider an animation asset for a 3D model.  The set of matricies that
// represent a particular frame in the animation is fairly specific to a particular model and
// where it is in that animation.  As such that is probably best represented as per-instance
// data.  However, decoding the animation from its persistant form to something that is easy
// to compute with is work that can be shared by every user of that animation.  As such that
// makes a good candidate for singleton state.  Not all asset types will have both kinds of
// state.  For example XML assets would likely only have singleton state, containing the parsed
// XML document.
//
// This leads naturally into the second point.  When implementing an asset type, it needs to be
// possible to code the semantics of both the singleton and per-instance behaviors.  The singleton
// implementation is typically created after the data has loaded into memory, where it is then
// resposible for parsing the data of the asset, as well as factorying per-instance data and
// child assets (if any).  Implementation of singleton semantics must implement AssetSingleton,
// and per-instance semantics must implement AssetInstance.  If there are no per-instance semantics
// the AssetSingleton implementation can return itself as the instance data and the system will
// behave correctly.  Associating the semantic implementation with a particular kind of asset is
// done though static registration when there is a way to determine this association prior to
// loading the bits.  A more complex association factory is needed when this is not the case.
//
// Editing of assets is controlled through a seperate interface (AssetEdit), if a particular
// asset type provides this interface via Unknown::getInterface, then that asset supports being
// edited.  There may be multiple instances of AssetEdit types created for an asset at the same
// time.  There is minimal synchronization between these instances.  The system only promises
// that commits of edits will appear to any users of the asset in the order they are committed.
